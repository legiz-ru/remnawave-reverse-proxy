## Installing Node.js and npm

To contribute to the Remnawave Reverse-proxy project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


## Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the Remnawave Reverse-proxy repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eGamesAPI/remnawave-reverse-proxy
```

```bash
cd remnawave-reverse-proxy/docs
```

## Installing Dependencies

Before you can build the documentation, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in the `docs` directory.

```bash
npm install
```

To build the documentation locally, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, and you can view the documentation at `http://localhost:4321`.

### 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
