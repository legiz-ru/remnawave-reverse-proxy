THIS REPOSITORY IS AN EDUCATIONAL EXAMPLE FOR LEARNING NGINX, REVERSE PROXY AND NETWORK SECURITY BASICS. THIS SCRIPT DEMONSTRATES NGINX CONFIGURATION AS A REVERSE PROXY. NOT FOR PROD AND NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE! IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE CONTROL PANEL WORKS - THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, NOT THE SCRIPT AUTHOR'S. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
:::

## Server uses Nginx Reverse-Proxy

This script is designed to streamline the setup of a reverse proxy server using NGINX and Xray, as well as to automate the installation of the Remnawave control panel and node. In this configuration, Xray operates directly on port 443, forwarding traffic through a socket that NGINX listens to. This approach minimizes unnecessary TCP overhead, delivering improved performance and connection reliability.

:::note[Important]
Supports Debian and Ubuntu. The script has been tested in a KVM virtualization environment. For proper operation, you will need your own domain. It is recommended to run it with root privileges on a freshly installed system.
:::

The script supports deployment on either a single server (with both the panel and node together) or two separate servers, depending on your needs:

- Single Server: Ideal for a compact setup where the control panel and Xray node are installed on the same machine.
- Panel Server: Serves as the central management hub, without hosting an Xray node.
- Node Server: Hosts the Xray node along with a Self Steal stub for VLESS REALITY. To ensure proper operation, you need to prepare three domains (or subdomains) in advance: the first will be used for the control panel, the second for handling subscriptions, and the third for the Self Steal stub site, which is hosted on the node server.

## Panel Protection via URL Parameter

To enhance the security of the panel, an additional layer of protection against detection has been implemented in the NGINX configuration:

- To access the panel, you must navigate to a URL in the following format:

```
https://panel.example.com/auth/login?<SECRET_KEY>=<SECRET_KEY>
```

- This request automatically sets a special Cookie in the browser with the name `<SECRET_KEY>` and the value `<SECRET_KEY>`.
- If the Cookie is missing or the URL request lacks the specified parameter, the user will encounter either a blank page or a 404 error, depending on the requested path.

This mechanism ensures the panel remains hidden from unauthorized access. Even if an attacker attempts to scan the host or brute-force paths, they will be unable to access the panel without the correct parameter and corresponding Cookie.

## Proxy server configuration

1. Proxy server configuration:
    - Support for automatic configuration updates via subscription and JSON subscription with the ability to convert to formats for popular applications.
2. NGINX reverse proxy setup in combination with Xray.
3. Security measures:
    - UFW setup for access management.
    - Cloudflare/ACME SSL certificates with automatic renewal
    - Manage IPv6 to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
    - BBR optimization for TCP connections.
    - Selecting a random website template from an array.

## Features and restrictions on access to API :badge[New]

### Local API Access

In the eGames's script, the Remnawave panel runs locally on port `3000`. For local API access, you can use:

* **Direct connection:** `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/`
* **SDK connection:** Using the Remnawave SDK with the base URL `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

### External API Access

The eGames's script implements a panel protection system via cookie-based authorization, which introduces the following restrictions:

* **Required special cookie:** External access to the panel requires a cookie named `<SECRET_KEY>` with the value `<SECRET_KEY>`.
* **URL parameter for initial access:** The first access must be made through a URL containing a secret parameter, which sets the required cookie.
* **Direct API access blocked:** Without the correct cookie, all API requests will return either a blank page or a 404 error.

## Legal Notice

:::note[Important]
This repository is intended solely for educational purposes and for studying the principles of reverse proxy servers and network security. The script demonstrates the setup of a proxy server using NGINX for reverse proxy, traffic management, and attack protection.

We strongly remind you that using this tool to bypass network restrictions or censorship is illegal in certain countries that have laws regulating the use of technologies to circumvent internet restrictions.

This project is not intended for use in ways that violate information protection laws or interfere with censorship mechanisms. We take no responsibility for any legal consequences arising from the use of this script.

Use this tool/script only for demonstration purposes, as an example of reverse proxy operation and data protection. We strongly recommend removing the script after reviewing it. Further use is at your own risk.

If you are unsure whether the use of this tool or its components violates the laws of your country, refrain from interacting with this tool.
